<h2> Description </h2>
<p align="justify">
  I am creating <em>Apache Spark 3 - Spark Programming in Python for Beginners </em>project to help you understand the Spark programming and apply that knowledge to build data engineering solutions. This project is example-driven and follows a working session like approach. We will be taking a live coding approach and explain all the needed concepts along the way.

<h3>Who should take this project?</h3>
<p align="justify">
I designed this project for software engineers willing to develop a Data Engineering pipeline and application using the Apache Spark. I am also creating this project for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organizationâ€™s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Spark implementation. Still, they work with the people who implement Apache Spark at the ground level.

<h3>Spark and source code version</h3>
<p align="justify">
This project is using the Apache Spark 3.x. I have tested all the source code and examples used in this project on Apache Spark 3.0.0 open-source distribution.
